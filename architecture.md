# ðŸ§  Takumi Architecture

Takumi is built as a modular AI agent with the following pipeline:

```
Perception â†’ Emotion Engine â†’ Decision Engine â†’ Execution â†’ Reflection
```

### Components:
- **Perception Layer**: Pulls live market and sentiment data
- **Emotion Engine**: Calculates Takumi's emotional state
- **Decision Engine**: Maps emotion to a trading strategy
- **Execution Layer**: Simulates or executes trades
- **Reflection Loop**: Logs internal thoughts and outcomes

Each component is replaceable and independently testable.
