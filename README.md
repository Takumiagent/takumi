# 🧠 Takumi — Emotion-Driven Crypto AI

![Takumi Demo](assets/takumi_demo.gif)

Takumi is an experimental, emotionally-aware crypto trading agent. Inspired by Kuromi, Takumi doesn’t just calculate — he *feels*.

> “Master of emotion. Student of the market.”

## ⚙️ System Overview

Takumi runs on an adaptive emotional engine that reacts to price, volume, and social sentiment. His state influences how he trades — from aggressive “Oni” mode to passive “Shinobi” observation.

## 💡 Emotional States

| State    | Behavior                          |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Oni      | Buy aggressively on breakouts     |
| Kitsune  | Place deceptive orders            |
| Ronin    | Exit and wait in stablecoins      |
| Satori   | Rebalance based on trends         |
| Shōjo    | Light meme-trading                |
| Yūrei    | Suspends trading, logs data       |
| Shinobi  | Observes silently                 |
